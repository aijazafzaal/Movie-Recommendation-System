Built a movie recommendation system where you can type in movie name and get 10 tailored recommendations for other movies that you might want to watch. The project employs collaborative filtering to generate a recommendation score based on the data.    

STEPS:  
1. Read in movie data using pandas
2. Clean movie titles using regex
3. Create a tfidf matrix for the movie data
4. Create a search function to query the movie data
5. Build an interactive search box using Jupyter
6. Read in movie ratings data
7. Find users who liked the same movie
8. Determine how much all users like movies
9. Create a recommendation score for each movie
10. Build a recommendation function based on the recommendation score
11. Create an interactive recommendation widget for the movie recommendation system  

Libraries used: Pandas, numpy, re(regular expression library), sklearn, ipywidgets
